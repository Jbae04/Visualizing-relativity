# Relativity Lab: Explore Einstein's Universe

Relativity Lab is an interactive educational tool and visualizer designed to help students understand and explore Einsteinâ€™s theory of relativity through real-time mathematical simulations and visual representations. It integrates concepts from both Special and General Relativity into a unified, browser-based interface.

## Educational Value

This tool enhances learning by bridging the gap between theory and intuition. It allows students to:

- Visualize complex relativistic effects in real time
- Experiment with parameters such as velocity and mass
- Reinforce textbook concepts through interactive simulation
- Develop a stronger conceptual understanding of time, space, and gravity

It is suitable for high school and university-level physics, and useful in both formal instruction and independent study.

## Applications in Education

- Physics classroom demonstrations
- STEM outreach and science exhibitions
- Supplemental learning for AP Physics or college-level courses
- Concept testing and reinforcement for homework or review

---

## Technology Stack

- Python 3
- Streamlit (for web interface)
- Matplotlib, NumPy (for calculations and plotting)

The project is lightweight and can be deployed via platforms such as Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces.
